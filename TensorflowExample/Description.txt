in this project i got familiar with:

1. Importing Tensorflow into a Notebook
2. Building a Deep Neural Network with Fully Connected Layers
3. Training/Fitting a Tensorflow Network
4. Training the model and make predictions on test data with Pandas
5. Calculating Accuracy from Tensorflow Predictions
6. Save your model to disc and reload it to a Jupyter Notebook for reuse

Pandas is a library which allows data manipulation meaning we can analyze and prepare
data before doing a train test split which will train our neural network 

Neural networks are capable of learning highly complex and non-linear relationships 
between inputs and outputs. This ability allows them to perform tasks that are difficult
or impossible for traditional algorithms,

Using a neural network for a churn prediction is not necessary but i needed to see an example
of neural network implementation  before i started the action recognition project where i 
will be  Building and Training an LSTM Deep Learning Model

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically
designed to handle sequences of data and capture long-term dependencies. It is particularly
effective in situations where the order of data matters,just like the order of the frames
that we are going to provide the model for training matter.This frames 
will alter on be used to distinguish the action we are doing on the screen.
