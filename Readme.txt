when learning about Sign Language Action Recognition
i realised that i need to get familiar with other things before starting,
that is why i made the HandPoseEstimation and the TensorflowExampe side projects to 
demonstrate the things i will be using in the Main Project.

The order of the project creation ,leading up to the main one is:
1. Hand Pose Estimation
2. Tensorflow Example
3. Sign Language Action Recognition
