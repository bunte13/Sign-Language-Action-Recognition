by doing this project i got familiar with:
1. how to set up MediaPipe for Python
2. Estimate hand poses using MediaPipe Hands
3. Output images with detections using OpenCV

MediaPipe is a machine learning library, I used its hand detection features to 
distinguish my hands and show the landmarks of differend joints on my hands on the screen.
this is useful since I am going to be working on an action recognition model which will 
utilize landmarks of my whole body (MediaPipe Holistic)

OpenCV implementation - an image processing library which is used to display the input from the camera
and draw the landmarks on the screen, this library is going to be used later on for 
drawing the Actions the model is going to be detecting in the Action Recognition project
